How do you personally research on the web?
Personally, I surf the web when I need help with a problem or have a question. The type of search that I do, I am not looking for the solution of the problem, but the explanation of the case and being able to understand it. Nowadays, web investigations are essential to collect information and be able to solve most of the questions in a project, or assignment. Web development is not the exception of the case since searching for web things within another web helps to understand and be able to guide you on how to start or finish a project in process.

What tips and tricks do you have to search the web?
The search method that I use when I search the web are more general questions on the subject, error codes, or possible causes of an error. Google is a means of searching by word, it is not a platform with artificial intelligence which reads what you write and looks for an answer. The best type of search that can be used in that case is to ask through keywords, and wait for a full article of that information. Which you will have to read completely and only use the information that favors you.

What is "Tutorial Hell"?
Tutorial Hell is when a programmer creates self-reliance on tutorials in order to finish a project, this causes the project to be completed using a lot of pointless code and the developer does not feel the confidence or the need to do it himself.

How do you best learn development and JavaScript?
For me, what worked for me to learn JavaScript was to see super long tutorials explaining the function of each array or added code. They were super long tutorials of hours but it helped me understand a lot how and why everything works. Always my problem is that when something is added and I do not understand why it is so, I feel curious to understand why and my mind does not focus as it should on the following.

How would you recommend someone new to web development learn the skill and why?
I would recommend that in each tutorial you follow each step and understand it because it is each step, and after that you develop it in any way for your mind to analyze it and understand it the way you are used to learning. Also to practice a lot and program small to bigger things to practice what you have learned. When someone learns a language, it takes the brain to memorize the word until it is heard 14 times. Development are different languages learned over time, which will become easier and easier depending on constant practice.
