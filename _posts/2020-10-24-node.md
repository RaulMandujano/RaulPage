•	What is Node JS?
Node is an internal platform that runs Javascript code that run in V8 Chrome motor in the backend without the need for a browser to perform specific functions. Node is developed so that entry and exit operations are without blocking

•	When do you use Node?
In the world of WEB programming. Node being a language with the main backend function, it is used for non-blocking event-controlled servers. But since it complies with a thread nature, the one used in Web Pages to manipulate API information. It was originally thinking of real-time development, push-based architectures.
o	Four use cases:
API: Node is perfect for use with web pages with API, since it allows you to share information from one page with another in real time, and since the information comes from an external collaborator, it makes the page without information problems when loading.
Chat Applications: Since NODE has input and output information handling without block, it is perfect for developing a chat. You can send and receive information in real time running the server on the back end.
Streaming: Since node is perfect for handling large or heavy information. It is perfect to be used in streaming, or to manage information stored in the cloud and use it in real time. Being able to view a file, video, or photo without having to download it uses node, due to its speed of sharing information.
Big-data and Analytics: It helps to make the page performance faster and the wait time is instantaneous. Quickly manage the inputs and outputs of the content, give an answer at the moment of the search.


•	What are some ways that Node differs from JS in the browser?
Javascript works more in the part where you can see, and interact with the interface. Practically it is the part of the code that the user can see on the page.
Node is practically Javascript but the backend, the part that makes the page work but cannot be seen. The part that works with the google V8 engine

•	What is Express JS?	Why is it useful?
Since NODE.js is literally Javascript, node has its own framework library called express.js. Being node a free working platform, express facilitates the full use of the various functionalities of Node.js. The code used in express.js is much cleaner and easier to understand.

•	Why would a developer choose to use a Templating Engine?
The use of a template engine facilitates the use of the website so that designers can add or modify content, since in that way the people in charge of the graphic part have better and easier access to modifications. It allows a more accessible use of modifying the HTML and still allows being used with the JavaScript without the complexity of interlinking them. Also, when using a template engine, it makes the content more uniform, that is, it helps the content have a simultaneous synchrony.

•	What Templating Engine did you choose and why?
I chose to use React as the template engine because It is the one I am most related to since I used it for my other classes. I finished part of my capstone project using React and I think it could be a good idea to use it here because of the popularity it has been getting in the last years.
