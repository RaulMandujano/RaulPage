SQL and NoSQL are very similar languages whose main objective is the same function, which is the handling of information.

  •	Explain the main features of each type of database and When would you use each type?
  
SQL has a transaction support including stability, security and scalability. It also includes a powerful graphical administration area that allows SQL to use DDL and DML commands graphically.
SQL also allows working in a client-server mode, where we find the hosted database is the server and clients only access the information.
One of the most outstanding characteristics of NoSQL is flexibility, it can be defined as new data is added. This helps the system increase performance by working horiozontal scaling with which to distribute the load of all nodes.
MongoDB is a database best recommended for environments with low resources in computer systems. The coast is low and has great documentation at a low price. It is completely perfect working with JavaScript.

  •	What are the differences?
  
One of the differences in productive form of SQL is that it allows you to extract related information from different tables. While NoSQL in some cases does not allow it or does so in a limited way, NoSQL allows the modern user to move large amounts of information and facilitates the database distribution.
Unlike SQL and NoSQL, MongoDB does not work for large companies that require a more powerful system.

  •	What are the advantages and disadvantages?
  
One drawback and the most seen problem among NoSQL I would say is the incompatibility between SQL statements. Another disadvantage would be cross-platform support and lack of standardization.

In SQL, a disadvantage is the large space in RAM that it requires to install and update the software. It is very complicated or almost impossible to use it for practice because it prohibits many things. It only has system support for windows.

MongoDB is not suitable for a database with complex transactional applications. And the advantage is that for jobs with simpler requirements, it is offered at a good price.
