![Git And Github Version Control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22435576/106373491-406a6e00-6337-11eb-8738-5ae85345ae74.png)

**•	What is Git?**

Git is used to be able to control master repositories locally. It is important because it helps with the development of a project and allows keeping a record of the updated codes or aggregator in the same project. This solves the problem of migrating new add-ons from different ones and doing it manually. By accepting and migrating a pull request, drastic modifications can be made depending on the request sent.

**•	What is GitHub?**

Github is essentially created for all types of development with collaborations being a code hosting platform, the stored code can be accessed through forks and clone repositories. This gives programmers better code management.
The great advantages of this platform are the accessibility it offers to multiple programmers to be able to create, change, request modifications, create new features and be able to do testing.

**•	What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

These are totally different.
Git is a version control system which allows to track and monitor code changes through commands. Allows you to create and move through branches remotely creating commits with saved code information.
Meanwhile
Github is a code hosting platform, which allows you to store and share finished works through remote repositories. Git is only a tool to be able to manipulate and create collaborations with the Github storage through commands. Git works freely from Github.
