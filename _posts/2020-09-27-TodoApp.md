My application performs the function of adding tasks, completing them, modifying them and eliminating them if necessary. The page has a function to add categories to be able to separate and differences when you add a task. To this it adds the extra function of being able to search for tasks at the top, the searchbar function to search for tasks or categories of tasks.
My application was designed in this way, it fulfills the main function it has, to add and complete tasks. It is designed in a simple way to allow better interaction with the user.

The biggest challenge I had in developing this application was making it categorize the added tasks. And another was, to be able to make it work with MacOS, for some reason I could not make the code created in Windows work in MacOS.
I could solve the problem of categorizations by adding functions to the categories and adding the categories by default.

I think that next time, I would like to create a calendar with Todo Lists because it is something that I use in my day to day. And I would be interested to see what it would look like creating it from scratch.
