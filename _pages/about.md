My name is Raul Mandujano, I born and raise in Lima Peru until the age of 17 then I moved to the United States. I always loved technology and I liked to increamy my personal knowledge, I learned Graphic Design when I was 11 in CorelDraw. I also learned JAVA long time ago when I was 15, and I don’t remember it very well. I haven’t learn anymore until I started the web program at Utah Valley University. I am currently taking my last classes at UVU, and I am very excited to keep learning and grow as a developer.

I am excited to gradutate and try ot find a job related with my carrear. For this class I hope to learn everything from JavaScrip, and increase my current knowledge or what this class cover is fine.

## Thing I do for fun

- Go camping
- Live Stream my gameplays
- Walk my dogs
