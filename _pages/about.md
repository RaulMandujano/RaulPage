My name is Raul Mandujano, I born and raise in Lima Peru until the age of 17 then I moved to the United States. I always loved technology and I liked to increamy my personal knowledge, I learned Graphic Design when I was 11 in CorelDraw. I also learned JAVA long time ago when I was 15, and I don’t remember it very well. I haven’t learn anymore until I started the web program at Utah Valley University. I am currently taking my last classes at UVU, and I am very excited to keep learning and grow as a developer. 

What is your favorite part of web development?
My favorite part of being a developer is when you have a project done and you see what you have created from scratch. I think it is a satisfactory logo.

What do you hope to learn in this class?
I hope to understand better JavaScript and all for what JS is used today.

I am excited to gradutate and try ot find a job related with my carrear. For this class I hope to learn everything from JavaScrip, and increase my current knowledge or what this class cover is fine.
